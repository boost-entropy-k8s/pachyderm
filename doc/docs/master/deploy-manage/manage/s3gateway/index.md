# Global S3 Gateway 

Pachyderm comes with an embedded **S3 gateway**, deployed in the `pachd` pod, that allows you to
**access Pachyderm's repo through the S3 protocol**.  

The S3 Gateway is designed to work with any S3 Client, among which: 

- MinIO
- AWS S3 cli
- boto3

The operations on the HTTP API exposed by the S3 Gateway largely mirror those documented in [S3â€™s official docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/). It is typically used when you wish to retrieve data from or expose data to object storage tooling (such as MinIO, boto3, and aws s3 cli). 

!!! Info
    `pachd` service exposes the S3 gateway (`s3gateway-port`) on port **30600**.

!!! Note "Before using the S3 Gateway"
    Make sure to install and configure the S3 client of your choice as documented [here](configure-s3client.md).

## Quick Start
The S3 gateway presents **each branch from every Pachyderm repository as an S3 bucket**.
Buckets are represented via `branch.repo`. 

!!! Example
    The `master.data` bucket corresponds
    to the `master` branch of the repo `data`.

The following diagram gives a quick overview of the two main aws commands
that will let you put data into a repo or retrieve data from it via the S3 gateway. 
For reference, we have also mentioned the corresponding `pachctl` commands
and the equivalent call to a real s3 Bucket.

## If Authentication Is Enabled
If [auth is enabled](../../../enterprise/auth/enable-auth.md) on the Pachyderm cluster, credentials must be passed with
each S3 gateway endpoint as mentioned in the [**Configure Your S3 Client**](./configure-s3client/#set-your-credentials) page.

!!! Warning "Important"
    In any case, whether those values are empty (no authentication) or set, the Access Key must equal the 
    Secret Key (both set to the same value). 

## Port Forwarding
If you do not have direct access to the Kubernetes cluster, you can use port
forwarding instead. Run `pachctl port-forward`, which will allow you
to access the s3 gateway through the `localhost:30600` endpoint.

However, the Kubernetes port forwarder incurs substantial overhead and
does not recover well from broken connections. Connecting to the
cluster directly is faster and more reliable.

## Versioning
Most operations act on the `HEAD` of the given branch. However, if your object
store library or tool supports versioning, you can get objects in non-`HEAD`
commits by using the commit ID as the S3 object version ID.
